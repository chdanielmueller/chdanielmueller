### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel MÃ¼ller, also known as [@chdanielmueller](https://github.com/chdanielmueller).
I work for my own company [@Surnet](https://github.com/Surnet) and publish most of my open source contributions there.

I did my apprenticeship as a System Engineer in [Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­](https://goo.gl/maps/MSF7yh61rdnBymNV7) and now work as a full-stack developer.
If you want to learn more about me or join my network please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chdanielmueller/) profile.

I teach young students on the topics of system engineering and application development and I am involved in making sure to keep a high quality education in Switzerland.
